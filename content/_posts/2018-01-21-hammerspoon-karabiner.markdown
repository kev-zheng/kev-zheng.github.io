[**Hammerspoon**](http://www.hammerspoon.org/) is an incredibly powerful wrapper around OSX, allowing you to easily interact with the OS via scripting, such as trigger notifications, move and resize windows, open applications, etc.

[**Karabiner\-Elements**](https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements) is a keyboard customization tool. I use this to remap keys to make it simple to trigger my Hammerspoon scripts from the keyboard.

#### Features

* [position](#position) - Instantly resize windows into halves of your screen
* [focus](#focus) - Shift focus (i.e. click) onto an app, or launch if not open
* [monitor](#monitor) - Move windows between external monitors or [spaces](https://support.apple.com/kb/ph25574?locale=en_US)
* [gcal](#gcal) - Menu bar to see all of your upcoming calendar events
* [timer](#timer) - Pomodoro timer to keep you focused

# position

Window positioning module [borrowed](https://gist.github.com/teknofire/a311390d0427c09e7be6044d09c8d372) from Miro Mannino.

`hyper + right` resizes window to right side of screen.

`hyper + left` resizes window to left side of screen.

`hyper + up` resizes window to upper side of screen.

`hyper + down` resizes window to bottom side of screen.

Repeated presses of above keys will cycle window to take up half, quarter, and 2/3 of screen.

`hyper + enter` resizes window to entire screen

Repeated presses of `hyper + enter` will cycle through resizing similarly.

# focus

File containing hotkey bindings. Each segment binds a hotkey to a useful application - such as `hyper + c` to launch `Google Chrome`

![Focus gif]({{ "/gifs/focus.gif" | relative_url}})

# monitor 

Keybindings used to interact with an external monitor, or between spaces within a monitor. Very useful for moving applications back and forth.

`hyper + shift + right` cycles the current application to monitor on the right

`hyper + shift + keft` cycles the current application to monitor on the left

`hyper + shift + h` moves the current application to a space on the left

`hyper + shift + l` moves the current application to a space on the right

![Spaces gif]({{ "/gifs/spaces.gif" | relative_url}})

# gcal

Constructs a menubar. Uses the Google Calendar API to fetch events, colors, timing, etc. to a json file, which are then loaded into the menubar on each refresh.

# timer

A simple pomodoro timer! Sets a default time for 25 minutes, with option to pause and cancel.

# How to use

## Karabiner-Elements

Karabiner\-Elements is a relatively new tool made when OSX Sierra came out. As a result, installing it is a bit of a hassle as it‚Äôs still under continuous development. Follow the instructions in the `How to Build` section in the link [above](https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements). It requires installing C++ Boost Libraries, XCode Build tools beforehand but should compile into a standalone application, which doesn‚Äôt need to be compiled every time you update.

edit: [it can now be downloaded directly as a package!](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/)

Use Karabiner to make a `hyper` key. I rebinding my `caps lock` key (which I never use) into `ctrl+alt+cmd`. Do this by editing your `karabiner.json` file located in `~/.config/karabiner`. [See my file here that you can copy/paste](https://github.com/kev-zheng/hammerspoon/blob/master/karabiner.json)

## Hammerspoon

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon). I recommend familiarizing with it through the getting started guide [here](http://www.hammerspoon.org/go).

Hammerspoon interacts with the operating system using the Lua language, which is an easy to learn scripting language. Whenever hammerspoon is loaded or refreshed, your `~/.hammerspoon/init.lua` file is processed. You can use the console as a REPL for lua code.

To start, I defined the hyperkey

`init.lua`
```
hyper = {"ctrl", "alt", "cmd"}
```

and followed the [docs](http://www.hammerspoon.org/docs/hs.application.html#launchOrFocus) to build the focusing hotkey

`focus.lua`
```

    hs.hotkey.bind(hyper, "C", function ()
      hs.application.launchOrFocus('Google Chrome')
    end)
    
    hs.hotkey.bind(hyper, 'E', function ()
      hs.application.launchOrFocus('Visual Studio Code')
    end)
    
```

The file `focus.lua` is separate from `init.lua`. To activate this code, all I need to do is include `focus.lua`

`init.lua`
```
require('focus')
```

Hammerspoon has a great community that have built a ton of other [spoons](https://github.com/Hammerspoon/Spoons) and [sample configurations](https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon/wiki/Sample-Configurations). For instance, I borrowed the fantastic [resizing hotkey](https://github.com/miromannino/miro-windows-manager) functionality from another user.
