  1: <h1> Take off! </h1> The journey begins with a grueling 20 hour flight from Detroit to Brisbane

  2: On the flight, a picture of a plane flying close by. It's now one of my favorite pictures taken.

  3: Looking down, a shot of the snow covered plains somewhere over the Rockies

  6: Always looking too serious ...

  8: The Twelve Apostles

  9: A helicopter on its way to fight the forest fires

  10: I only brought a 35mm lens, so I played around with stitching a couple shots together in post.

  12: Inside the lighthouse at Cape Otway

  17: At the Melbourne Zoo

  20: Astrophotography at Mount Cook

  21: Mount Cook from afar (the water was actually that blue!)
